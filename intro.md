# Welcome to by blog

This is my blog and I usually write about technical stuff. Most of the articles are written for myself to remember/understand the topics that I've not understood.

I am an software engineer who has a passion of writing Go code. However, I also love programming in Python, C/C++, JavaScript and Clojure.

In my spare time I learn algorithms and contribute to opensource projects.

Feedbacks and suggestions are appreciated (feel free to email me)
